Yi Yu is a PhD student under an academic collaboration between the Australian National University (ANU) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Yi received a B.Mgmt. in Land Resources Management from Southwest University in 2018 and an M.Sc. in Environment (Advanced) from The Australian National University in 2020, where he developed great interests in remote sensing and geospatial modelling. His research interests can be summarised as 'to better understand spatiotemporal variability of earth observations from a continental scale'. Yi's PhD project is to explore the role of land surface temperature in improving spatiotemporal predictability of soil moisture-related stress in vegetation. He is also working on an ANU-CSIRO Himawari-8 project which aims at developing best-practice geostationary data products for enhanced sub-daily monitoring of Australiaâ€™s ecosystems.
