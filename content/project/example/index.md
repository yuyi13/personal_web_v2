The interaction between static soil properties and dynamic climate and moisture data layers are fundamental to better modelling of agricultural productivity and sustainable landscape management. Accurate quantification of the spatial and temporal characteristic of soil moisture requires the appropriate integration of soil property information with soil water dynamics, and given the different representation of the soil profile in various models (e.g., hydrological and yield prediction models) this integration is rarely as straight forward as ‘plug-and-play’. Soil moisture measurement techniques are many and varied, ranging from sparse in-situ and proximal sensing technologies through to comprehensive yet indirect (and coarse) remote sensing data products. The challenge of integrating these data along with soil property information to better enable crop production prediction and forecasting capability remains an active area of cutting-edge research.
