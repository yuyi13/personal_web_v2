The interaction between static soil properties and dynamic climate and moisture data layers are fundamental to better modelling of agricultural productivity and sustainable landscape management. Accurate quantification of the spatial and temporal characteristic of soil moisture requires the appropriate integration of soil property information with soil water dynamics, and given the different representation of the soil profile in various models...
