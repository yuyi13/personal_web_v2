The project’s main aim was to develop methods that could routinely make use of satellite sensing of soil moisture in the operational AWRA modelling system to improve water balance modelling and forecasting capability for the whole country. Three candidate satellite soil moisture data were explored: NASA-JAXA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP); ESA’s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); and Eumetsat’s Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT).
