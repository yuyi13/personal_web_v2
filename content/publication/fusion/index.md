abstract: Fine spatial resolution land surface temperature (LST) data are crucial to study heterogeneous landscapes, but many commonly used spatiotemporal fusion methods may not be suitable for direct application in LST studies due to their high sub-diurnal dynamics. We proposed a variant of a famous spatiotemporal fusion method, namely ubESTARFM, which uses coarse LST as reference to locally conduct bias correction, specifically designed to accommodate the high temporal dynamics to generate fine-resolution LST estimates.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We proposed a variant of a spatiotemporal fusion method to better accommodate LST's high temporal dynamics to generate fine-resolution LST estimates.
